Week 26: Next.js Basic Assignment
This week's assignment is designed to help you learn and practice key concepts of Next.js 14, including file-based routing with the App Router, navigation, layout components, static rendering, and client-side rendering with the "use client" directive.

Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will build a Next.js application from scratch using the App Router structure. The application will consist of three routes: Home, Static Route, and Interactive Route. You will create a navigation bar component to enable seamless navigation between these routes. The Static Route will demonstrate static rendering, while the Interactive Route will showcase client-side rendering and interactivity using the "use client" directive.

Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience and understanding of the following Next.js 14 concepts:

File-based Routing with App Router: Learn how Next.js 14 uses file-based routing with the App Router, where each file in the app directory corresponds to a route in the application.

Navigation with Link Component: Understand how to use the Link component from next/link to create navigation links between different routes, enabling client-side navigation without a full page reload.

Layout Component: Discover how to create a layout component in Next.js 14 using layout.tsx, which wraps around the content of each route and allows for a consistent layout across the application.

Static Rendering: Explore how Next.js performs static rendering with the static route (static-page/page.tsx), where the content is generated at build time and served as pre-rendered HTML for better performance and SEO.

Client-Side Rendering with "use client": Learn about client-side rendering using the "use client" directive in the interactive route (interactive-page/page.tsx), which enables interactivity and state management using React hooks like useState.

Assignment Requirements
Follow these steps to complete the assignment:

Bootstrap a Next.js project with TypeScript.
Create a Navbar component with three navigation links: Home, Static Route, and Interactive Route.
Implement a layout component that includes the Navbar component and wraps around the content of each route, ensuring a consistent layout across all pages.
Implement the Home route with a welcoming message and introduction to your application.
Create the Static Route and display a static paragraph highlighting the benefits of static rendering in Next.js.
Implement the Interactive Route with a count button that increments the count when clicked, demonstrating client-side interactivity.
Ensure proper routing and navigation between the routes using the Link component.
Style your application as desired to achieve an appealing and user-friendly interface.
Refer to the UI images attached below for visual guidance on how your application should look and function.
